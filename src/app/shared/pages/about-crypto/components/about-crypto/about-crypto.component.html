    <h2>Cryptocurrency. Definition and description</h2>

    <p>Cryptocurrency is any type of currency in digital or virtual form; cryptocurrency uses encryption (cryptography)
        to protect transactions. There is no central authority for issuing or regulating cryptocurrencies. A
        decentralized system is used to record transactions and issue new units.</p>

    <h2>What is cryptocurrency?</h2>

    <p>Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that does not involve banks in checking transactions. It is a
        peer-to-peer system that allows any user, anywhere, to send and receive payments. Cryptocurrency payments exist
        solely in digital form in an online database describing specific transactions. They do not involve transactions
        with physical money, which has circulation and exchange possibilities in the real world. When funds are
        transferred in cryptocurrency, transactions are recorded in a public registry. Cryptocurrency is stored in
        digital wallets.

        The term Cryptocurrency came into use because encryption (cryptography) is used to verify transactions: advanced
        encryption is used to store and transmit cryptocurrency data between wallets and to public registries. The
        purpose of encryption is to ensure reliability and security.

        The first cryptocurrency was bitcoin, created in 2009 and the most well-known today. Cryptocurrency trading is
        interesting in terms of profits; as a result of speculation, there are periodic price spikes in
        cryptocurrencies.</p>

    <h2>How is cryptocurrency applied?</h2>

    <p>Cryptocurrencies are processed in a distributed public registry, a blockchain, where records of all transactions
        are kept and updated by the holders of the currency.

        Cryptocurrency units (coins) are created through the process of mining. This is a process in which computer
        processing power is used to solve complex mathematical problems, resulting in the generation of coins. Users can
        also buy currency from brokers and then store and spend it using crypto wallets.

        Cryptocurrency is not a tangible object; it is a key that allows a record or unit to be moved from one person to
        another without a trusted third party.

        Bitcoin has been around since 2009, but in financial terms, cryptocurrencies and the use of blockchain
        technology are still in their infancy; they are expected to develop rapidly in the future. In the future,
        cryptocurrencies could be used in trading stocks, bonds and other financial assets.</p>

    <h2>Examples of cryptocurrencies</h2>

    There are thousands of cryptocurrencies. The most famous of them are listed below:

    <h2>Bitcoin</h2>

    <p> Bitcoin, created in 2009, was the first cryptocurrency and still maintains the highest popularity. The currency
        was developed by Satoshi Nakamoto - it is believed to be a pseudonym of a person or group of people, and the
        exact identity
        of the developer remains unknown.</p>

    <h2>Ethereum</h2>


    <p> The Ethereum blockchain platform was developed in 2015. It has its own cryptocurrency Ether (ETH) or

        banks and financial institutions.</p>

    <h2>How to buy cryptocurrency?</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p> Traditional brokers. These are online brokers offering to buy and sell cryptocurrencies as well as other
                financial assets: stocks, bonds, ETFs. These platforms tend to offer lower trading
                commissions, but fewer cryptocurrency features.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Cryptocurrency exchanges. There are many cryptocurrency exchanges, each offering a different
                cryptocurrencies, wallet storage, interest-bearing account options, and more. Many exchanges charge a
                commission

    <h2>What can I buy for cryptocurrency?</h2>
    <p>Bitcoin was originally conceived as a medium for everyday transactions, allowing you to buy anything from a cup
        of coffee to a computer or even high-value items such as real estate. These plans have not yet fully
        materialized. Despite the growing number of institutions accepting cryptocurrencies, large transactions using
        cryptocurrencies are quite rare. Nevertheless, it is possible to buy various goods with cryptocurrency on
        e-commerce sites. Here are a few examples.</p>

    <h2>Websites of technology companies and e-commerce</h2>

    <p> Websites of certain companies that sell technology products can make payments in cryptocurrency. Examples
        include newegg.com, AT&T and Microsoft. E-commerce platform Overstock was one of the first sites to accept
        bitcoins. Bitcoins can also be used to pay for purchases on Shopify, Rakuten, and Home Depot.</p>

    <h2>Luxury goods</h2>

    <p> Some luxury retailers accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment. For example, online luxury retailer Bitdials
        offers Rolex, Patek Philippe, and other exclusive watches for bitcoins.</p>

    <h2>Cars</h2>

    <p> Some car dealers, from mass-market brands to luxury dealers, also accept cryptocurrency as payment.</p>

    <h2>Insurance</h2>

    <p> In April 2021, AXA, a Swiss insurance company, announced that it would begin accepting bitcoins as a payment
        method for all insurance programs except life insurance (due to regulatory concerns). Premier Shield Insurance,
        which sells property and auto insurance policies in the U.S., is also accepting bitcoins to pay premiums.</p>

    <p> To pay with cryptocurrency at a store that does not accept it directly, you can use a cryptocurrency debit card,
        such as BitPay in the United States.</p>
